 *              exposes Dolibarr third parties and contacts to Cypht as a
 *              read-only contact source.
 *
 *              The module set itself lives in templates/dolibarr_contacts
 *              and is copied into vendor/jason-munro/cypht on every build,
 *              so a "composer update" cannot silently revert it.
